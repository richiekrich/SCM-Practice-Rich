# Software Configuration Management (SCM) and GitHub

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the process of tracking and controlling changes in software. It encompasses practices such as version control, change management, and release management to help teams manage code evolution and maintain product stability.

GitHub leverages Git—a distributed version control system—to enhance SCM by enabling:
- **Version Control:** Every change is tracked, allowing you to review history and revert changes when necessary.
- **Collaboration:** Teams can work concurrently on separate branches, review each other’s work, and merge changes seamlessly.
- **Branch Management:** Feature development or bug fixes can be isolated from the main codebase until they’re ready to be integrated.
  
This organized approach not only improves team collaboration but also helps manage the inherent complexity of modern software projects.
